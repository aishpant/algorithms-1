# Algorithms, Part I
Here I will be tracking the programming assignments of the course [Algorithms-1] (https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1/ "Coursera") on Coursera. 


>Okay so there is a lot of effects in trying to understand the running time of a program on, on your machine 
... algorithm you're using and what's the data. And that's going to really determine the exponent in the power law. 
In modern systems it is so much going on in the hardware and software, it's sometimes difficult to get really precise 
measurements. But on the other hand we don't have to sacrifice animals, or fly to another planet the way they do in other 
sciences, we can just run a huge number of experiments and usually take care of understanding these kind of effects.
